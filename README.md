# refactoring
Starting program with test setup for Fowler's [Refactoring](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html). 

This repo provides you with the starting code for the example program from Chapter 1 of the book. It also provides an intial basic test using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/). It is advised to follow the refactorings in the book by making changes to `src` files in this repo and adding appropriate tests.

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jgill/refactoring.git
cd refactoring
npm install
```

## To run tests
1. Open console.
1. Execute `npm test` in console.
1. Mocha tests will run and display test results in console.

## To monitor program
1. Open console.
1. Execute `npm start` in console.
Your console will now automatically compile and run the program after source code changes.
